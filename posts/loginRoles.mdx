## NextAuth Login Roles:

When I first started using [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction) I was surprised to find that they had no instructions on implementing role based
authentication. I felt that this was a basic authentication feature that would have been "batteries included" in many auth frameworks. This was a bit puzzling, but I knew there had to be
a way to do it.

## Database Adapter:

By default, NextAuth does not uses a Jason Web Token based authentication method. There is no database, 3rd party 0-auth providers provide a token that is stored in the userâ€™s local storage.
The option is available to use a database adapter that lets the developer keep track of session information in a database. With a database keeping track of sessions, all I needed to do was
extend the database user table to include a role. In this case I used [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) to manage my database.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-javascript"
    file="/prisma/schema.prisma"
    code={`
    model User {
    id            String    @id @default(cuid())
    name          String?
    email         String?   @unique
    emailVerified DateTime?
    image         String?
    role          String? //add role to the recommended schema.
    superUser     Boolean? @default(false)
    accounts      Account[]
    sessions      Session[]
    }
`}
/>

## Returning user role

NextAuth offers several custom callbacks that override default behavior if provided. The session callback is where I found I could include my user roles.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-javascript"
    file="/pages/auth/[...nextauth].js"
    code={`
    export default NextAuth({
        callbacks: {
            async session({ session, token, user }) {
                session.user.role = user.role; //pass role to session hooks
                return session;
            },
        },
    })
`}
/>

## Check for role using session hooks

Now that the user role is being returned by NextAuth we can test the users role when calling a session hook.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-javascript"
    file="/pages/auth/[...nextauth].js"
    code={`
    import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";

    function Body() {
        const session = await getSession({ req })
        return(
            if (session && session.user.role === "admin") {
                //do something
            } else {
                //do something else
            }
        )
    }

`}
/>

## My first PR

Roles being omitted from the official documentation seemed like a major omission. Many, if not most, authentication systems need a way to keep track of roles.
I stumbled through [creating a pull request](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/pull/4449) and it was merged, \\0/ , on May 6th, 2022.

[Role-based-login-strategy](https://next-auth.js.org/tutorials/role-based-login-strategy) is now an official guide for NextAuth.
