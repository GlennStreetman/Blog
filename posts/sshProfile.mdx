## Prerequisites:

This article assumes you are using Bash and that you have a remote machine with some sort of SSH server installed running on the default port 22.
The default ssh server will be refered to as jump in this article.
If you are on Linux you are likely good to go for this tutorial.
If you are on windows install [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and use it to run all commands.
Note that tilde(~), in reference to file paths, is the home directory for a user.

## SSH:

I use virtual machines & containers for all of my developer workflows. My deployments are hosted in Amazon [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/) virtual machines and the individual services
are containerized in [docker](https://www.docker.com/). As much as possible i try and build local development environments that are as similar as possible to my production envvironments.
My Amazon EC2 deployments use virtualized Ubuntu Server instances so my local development environment does the same on a local hypervisor. When i need to diagnose problems
with my EC2 deployment I connect to them using [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) & I do the same for my local environment. Because i shell into my dev environment
whenever I move between my desktop and laptop i simly open my shell from my new location and pick up directly where i left off. I'm never having to juggle git commits/pulls and having to worry about resolving
git conflicts if I do something out of order. Jumping through SSH boxes can get to be a bit arduous so here are some tricks to make the experience a bit better.

## SSH Key Pairs:

Connecting to a host using SSH can be done with either password authentication or a Private/Public key pair. They public key can be freely shared, the private key you never share. Many hosts have
password authentication disabled for security reasons. As a result i strongly recommend you always useing public/private key authentication when using SSH. If you don't already have a public/private key pair
you can create one with the command below. Make sure to enter a passphrase for your key. In this example the key file is saved as new_key.  
-C allows you to add a description.

<CodeBlock language="language-Bash" file="BASH>" code={`> ssh-keygen -C "bob-desktop"`} />

The above command generated two files, the one ending in .pub is your public key and can be freely shared.
Now that your keys have been generated lets copy our public key to our first destination.  
-i first: public key to be copied second: user/address to be copied too.
-p add this if ssh is not running on port 22. ex -p 2222

<CodeBlock language="language-Bash" file="BASH>" code={`> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/new_key.pub bob@192.168.102`} />

You can now login to 192.168.0.102 using your private key, shown below. Note that we are specifying the private key this time.

<CodeBlock language="language-Bash" file="BASH>" code={`> ssh-i ~/.ssh/new_key bob@192.168.102`} />

## SSH config file:

Having to specify keys and destinations can get tiring. You can create a shortcut by updating your ssh config file.

<CodeBlock language="language-Bash" file="BASH>" code={`> touch ~/.ssh/config`} />

Open your ssh config file and add a new host:

<CodeBlock
    language="language-Bash"
    file="~/.ssh/config"
    code={`HOST jump                         # new shortcut
    HostName 192.168.0.102        # can use IP address or domain name.
    user bob                      # user on target machine where ssh public key was copied to in previous step
    Port 22                       # defined on target machine in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (Linux)
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/new_key   # SSH private key, created in previous step.
`}
/>

Going forward typing "ssh jump" will connect to 192.168.0.102 on port 22.

## [SSH Agent](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/agent):

Opening SSH connections repeatedly requires entering ssh passwords on each connection, and for each command you remotely run.
Using [SSH agent](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/agent) you can enter your ssh password once per window then open as many connections as you want without having to re-enter the password.
In order to use ssh-agent you first need to start it up.

<CodeBlock language="language-Bash" file="BASH>" code={`> eval $(ssh-agent)`} />

Then you can add your keys

<CodeBlock language="language-Bash" file="BASH>" code={`> ssh-add ~/.ssh/new_key`} />
After running the above command you will be prompted for your password. Once you have entered it you wont need to enter it again as long as the terminal window stays
open.

## Streamlining SSH Agent by updating your .bashrc file:

Once you start to deal with more than a couple of ssh RSA keys adding your keys to ssh agent can become a bit clumsy.
I added a user defined function, that i can run from my bash terminal, by adding the function definition to my ~/.bashrc file.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-Bash"
    file="~/.bashrc"
    code={`function ssha {
    if [ -n "\$1" ]; then
        IDKEY=\$(ls ~/.ssh/ -1 | grep -v pub  | head -\$1 | tail -1)
        eval \$(ssh-agent)
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/\${IDKEY}
    else
        echo "Append key number to ssha to add key to ssh agent"
        ls ~/.ssh/ -1 | grep -v pub | nl;
    fi
}`}
/>

Save the above to ~/.bashrc then run the below command to reload your .bashrc file.

<CodeBlock language="language-Bash" file="BASH>" code={`> source ~/.bashrc`} />

With your .bashrc file updated and having executed the above command a new user defined command should be available in bash.  
ssha will return a numbered list of ssha keys saved in the users ~/.ssh/ directory. Update the script as needed if you save your RSA keys elsewhere.
ssha # will add the selected key to SSH Agent.

## Managing HOST names

As you add additional hosts to your host file remembering host names can become difficult. Add the below command to your .bashrc to quickly review your host names:

<CodeBlock
    language="language-Bash"
    file="~/.bashrc"
    code={`function host {
    if [ -n "$1" ]; then
        cat -n ~/.ssh/config | sed -n $1,$2p 
    else
        cat -n ~/.ssh/config | grep HOST
    fi
}`}
/>

Typing **_host_** will now print a numbered list of your HOST's, specified by your '~/.ssh/config' file. The number corresponds
to the line the host configuration starts on.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-Bash"
    file="BASH>"
    code={`> host
     3  HOST laptop
     9  HOST jump
    14  HOST localDev
    19  HOST remoteDev
    25  HOST deploy
`}
/>

Typing **_host # #_** will print a range of lines from the ~/ssh/config file, starting with the first number, ending with the second.
Use the second version of the command to peak at your HOST configuration without reviewing the whole file.
If the first command shows that the host you want to review starts on line 10, you could type **_host 9 18_** to print lines 9 through 18 from you config file.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-Bash"
    file="BASH>"
    code={`> host 9 18
     9  HOST jump
    10      HostName 192.168.0.102
    11      User bob
    12      Port 22
    13
    14  HOST localDev
    15      HostName 192.168.0.103
    16      user bob
    17      Port 2222
`}
/>

## Taking your .bashrc file with you

If you are spending time customizing your .bashrc file with new commands, themese, filter history, etc its disapointing to shell into a box
and not have your custom crafted profile with you. A couple of quick lines though and you can copy your .bashrc file from your local machine each time you jump
into a host. Go back to your ~/.ssh/config file from earlier and add the two new lines shown below. The LocalCommand line will run before the interactive ssh terminal is opened.
Each time an interactive terminal is opened **_source ~/.bashrc_** is automaticaly executed so all of your configuratations should be available on the remote machine.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-Bash"
    file="~/.ssh/config"
    code={`    PermitLocalCommand yes                                 #add this line

    HOST jump
        HostName 192.168.0.102
        user bob
        Port 22
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/new_key
        LocalCommand scp ~/.bashrc jump:/home/bob/.bashrc  #add this line

`}
/>

## Conclusion

Hopefully some of the configurations have made your SSH standard of living a bit better. SSH is a bit of a rabbit hole. SSH Security, jump boxes, tunneling
