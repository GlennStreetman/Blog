## The Problem:

The [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=nav-cta&utm_campaign=next-website)
guides you through building a simple blog using Next.js. The tutorial uses [Grey Matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter), a library that parses
[metadata](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/assets-metadata-css/metadata) stored at the top of .md markdown files. In the Next.js tutorial, metadata is used to sort and categorize blog posts.
The .md files, used in the tutorial, are not javascript though so you can't include javascript directly in your blog posts. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) fills this gap, allowing javascript to be imported
into markdown files (.mdx), but MDX does not support Grey Matter without using plugings. In this post we will use an easy work-around to include Grey Matter style markdown in MDX files, without including
any additional libraries or pluggins.

## Create a .mdx file, and export a component named meta:

MDX allows you to export javascript objects from markdown files. In each .mdx file, export your metadata as a javascript object. Add any metadata you plan on using for your blog or wiki.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-javascript"
    code={`export const Meta = {
    id: "buildScript",
    title: "MDX Dynamic import and parsing Meta data.",
    date: "2022-01-18",
    type: "notes",
    dependancies: "Tailwinds v3.08, Next v12.0.7, React v17.0.2",
    repo: "https://github.com/GlennStreetman/Blog",
    languages: "language-NPM,language-Next",
    project: "Blog",
};`}
/>
