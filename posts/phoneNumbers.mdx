## Building a Phone Number form component.

Recently I was building out forms for an automotive website. I needed to collect user phone numbers. Phone numbers are often formatted differently, 555-555-5555, (555) 555 5555, etc.
I knew that during my form validation step I would want to check that the phone number was valid before submitting the form. I found
[this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16699007/regular-expression-to-match-standard-10-digit-phone-number) and was getting ready to start writing code when I stopped myself.
Yes, I could use some horrific blob of regex to check every conceivable phone number format and validate that it looks like it might be a phone number

<CodeBlock
    language="language-javascript"
    file=""
    code={` function phoneIsValid(phone: string): boolean {
    return /^\s*(?:\+?(\d{1,3}))?[-. (]*(\d{3})[-. )]*(\d{3})[-. ]*(\d{4})(?: *x(\d+))?\s*$/.test(phone);
}
           
`}
/>

The above doesn't answer the whole question though. Do I really want to store every possible phone number format combination in my database? What do I do if I find something wrong with the regex above? I don't want
to spend time trouble shooting that. After giving it a bit of thought the answer on how to handle phone numbers is obvious. Phone numbers are just numbers, everything else is for display purposes only.
I should store phone numbers as numbers and layer formatting back in for display purposes.

## Create three functions

I first created three functions. A function to strip all the user provided formatting out of the phone number. A second function to layer dashes back in as needed. Finally, a third function
to check if the phone number is valid. Notice that the regular expression is a bit less complex.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-javascript"
    file="/lib/formatPhone"
    code={` 
    export function formatPhone(phone) {
        if (phone && typeof phone === "string") {
            const raw = phone.replace(/\D/g, ""); //replace any non-number
            let formatPhone;
            if (raw.length > 6) formatPhone = raw.slice(0, 3) + "-" + raw.slice(3, 6) + "-" + raw.slice(6);
            if (raw.length <= 6) formatPhone = raw.slice(0, 3) + "-" + raw.slice(3, 6);
            if (raw.length <= 3) formatPhone = formatPhone = raw;
            return formatPhone;
        } else {
            return "";
        }
    }

    export function stripPhone(phone) {
        if (phone && typeof phone === "string") {
            let strippedPhone = phone.replace(/(\D|^1)/g, ""); //replace any non number OR leading 1
            strippedPhone = strippedPhone.slice(0, 10);
            return strippedPhone;
        } else {
            return "";
        }
    }

    export function validPhone(phone) {
        if (phone && typeof phone === "string") {
            return phone.length === 10;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

`}
/>

## Setting up the phone number form field:

Now all I needed to do was create an Input field that uses the two functions above and check that the phone number is 10 digits before submitting.

<CodeBlock
    language="language-javascript"
    file="/lib/formatPhone"
    code={` 
    import {formatPhone, stripPhone, validPhone} from './lib/formatPhone'
    import LabeledInput from './components/labeledInput'

    const [phone, setPhone] = useState('')
    const [phoneHelp, setPhoneHelp] = useState('')

    function processRequest(){
        if (!validPhone(phone)) {setPhoneHelp('Please enter a valid phone number')} else {setPhoneHelp('Phone is valid')}
    }

    <LabeledInput
        autocomplete="tel"
        fieldType="tel"
        id="phone_id"
        label="Phone"
        value={formatPhone(phone)}
        onClickCallback={(e) => {
            setPhone(stripPhone(e));
        }}
        helperText={phoneHelp}
    />

    <button onClick={processRequest}>
        Submit
    </button>

`}/>

## Let's see the above in action

Notice that any extra characters do not get loaded into state. The display function, formatPhone, layers dashes back in to help with readability.

## Phone numbers are database keys

A phone book is just a big database of key value pairs. The phone number is a key, and the person is the value.
There is no reason to dirty your keys by including "for display purposes only" data. While I can't say for sure, I believe the
[Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16699007/regular-expression-to-match-standard-10-digit-phone-number),
linked at the beginning of the article, was most likely asking the wrong question. "How do I use a regex to identify all phone number formats" should most likely have been
"How do I consistently store phone number." Life is a lot easier when you don't /^\s*(?:\+?(\d{1,3}))?[-. (]*(\d{3})[-. )]_(\d{3})[-. ]_(\d{4})(?: _x(\d+))?\s_$/.test(phone);
