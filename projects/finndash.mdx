# Description

    FinnDash is a single page web application that adds a graphical user interface to Finnhub.io’s free financial API. It allows users to rapidly create 
    datasets, visualize those datasets, and share them using GraphQL and Excel templating.

# Technologies:

## React:

    Finndash was my first major full stack web apllication project. Having some experience working with Python's [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) & 
    [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) I knew that server side templating mixed with client side query selectors could quickly become difficult to organize 
    on more complicated pages. I wan't to to build a web app that could render user defined dynamic dashboards that didn't have many page transitions or reloads. Finndash would be 
    full of asynchronous code and callback functions so it would be helpful to find a way to encapsulate reusable functions in a way that made them easier to understand. 
    After researching available libraries I landed on [React](https://reactjs.org/). A single page web application that allowed me to package my code into reusable components 
    sounded extermely promising given my goals. [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) also included [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) which felt very familier coming from Flask.

## Redux & Redux Tool Kit:

    Users of FinnDash can rapidly specify thousands of API calls from [Finnhub.io](Finnhub.io), associated with any number of dashboards, that can return large chunks of JSON
    data. Once the data is sourced from [Finnhub.io](Finnhub.io) the data needed for display purposes on the dashboard needs to be cached on the client side. To save on future Finnhub.io 
    API calls additional data can be cached to MongoDB. The data that is stored on the client side then needs to be converted into a standard format using derived state. 
    As the user updates API data filters and reconfigures how widgets display data FinnDash needs to fire of actions that freshen data based on updated filters and derives new state based 
    on updated user configurations. Redux is a heavy-duty solution to global state management and is easily up to this task. Using Redux I was able to lift
    dashboard configurations & API data up into a global Redux state container. Derived state could consistently be updated using Redux’s
    action reducer model and composable asynchronous updates to global state could be created using Redux Thunks. After dashboard and API state was
    lifted out of Reacts component tree the need for prop drilling was greatly reduced and individual react component state could focus much more
    heavily on the view portion of the application, leaving the data model in Redux. One benefit of Redux, that should not be overlooked, is that
    all data store updates are handled using [Immer’s](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) immutable state updates. Using immutable state updates avoids object reference update 
    errors and avoids desynchronization between store state and what react renders. Updating deeply nested object state, and consistently creating
    new object references, is prone to error. Immer almost eliminates these hard to troubleshoot errors.

## Typescript:

    As FinnDash grew in complexity, debugging simple errors started eating up more and more time. Tracking down undefined reference errors and 
    correctly referencing object keys was called was creating more and more mental overhead. Typescript greatly reduced time spent debugging reference errors, 
    made it easier to reuse functions, and has often created a more enjoyable developer experience. Using typescript to define function interfaces and return 
    values has been a huge time saver and regularly catches errors during coding.

## Express:

    Finnhub’s route handling, database interactions, session/cookie management, file upload/download & parsing is handled by Express. I found
    Express to be a bit frustrating at times. It has very little included out of the box and doesn’t support some things, like es6 imports, out of
    the box. Session management, cookies, environmental variables, all require packages to be added to Express. If you come from a python
    background, and have used Flask or Bottle, Express should feel familiar. Just be ready to add each feature as needed.

## Postgres:

    User account and dashboard data is saved in Postgres. When Finndash’s Express backend first starts it compares the schema version, saved as an
    environmental variable, to the schema version saved in the database. If Express detects a difference in version, it sequentially runs the
    associated upgrade/downgrade scripts to build the correct schema. One big advantage of this is that when Finndash’s git repo is cloned to a new
    environment Express will build out the correct schema in Postgres the first time the application is started up.

## MongoDB:

    MongoDB is used to cache API JSON data returned by Finnhub.io. MongoDB promises to deal with large collections of JSON 
    data that are frequently updated, which is exactly what I’m doing with Finnhub.io’s API data. Avoiding any bottlenecking, by separating user
    login database requests from API data caching also might have some advantages if this project ever became more than a hobby Application.

## GraphQL:

    Empowering users, from a non-technical background, to share data specifications & API data, with both technical and non-technical team members,
    is one of the driving goals of FinnDash. GraphQL makes it easy to create links to datasets and communicate data specifications
    between team members. After a dashboard is created, the data stored in MongoDB, becomes accessible through GraphQL to team members. Team members
    can share links to their data sets and pivot the view, specifying which widgets & which securities, they want to share. Sharing GraphQL
    datasets is easier than managing, updating, and sharing groups of API endpoint query strings. Finnhub.io's API is also rate limited so caching Finnhub.io's 
    API data to graphQL eliminates tieing up Finnhub.io's API with duplicate requests.

## Material UI:

    [Material UI](https://mui.com/) is used to generate & style most of Finndash's comoponents. [MaterialUI 5.0's new sx prop](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/) 
    has really improved the experience of trying to customize the styling of MaterialUI's pre-build components.


## Jest & Testing Library:

    Tests are written using testing library and run with Jest.   

## Backend Tests
    Backend tests are performed using a mock server and session store, that import the routes to be tested. Database connections are not mocked out so that database interactions can be verified to be functional. 
    A separatee docker volume is specified to avoid contaminating the production database. 
    
## Frontend Tests
    Frontend tests are isolated from any HTTP requests using a mock HTTP server. HTTP requests are intercepted using a web worker and mock data is returned. 
    By mocking HTTP responses, tests can be performed against consistent HTTP return data & API rate limits aren't a concern. Each frontend test loads 
    the component being tested into a fresh version of the app so that integration tests can be performed.
    Mock HTTP responses test the components various functionalities so that all the component’s views and
    resulting side effects can be tested.  


## Infrastructure and Deployment

    Finndash is currently deployed using Amazons [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) on an Ununtu Server VM. Deployment is performed using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
